# Neuromorphic-Driving-Monitoring-System
 Firstly, the system 
will utilize the Media Pipe Python framework, a robust tool for facial landmark 
detection and tracking, to analyze real-time video feeds captured by onboard 
cameras. This involves identifying and tracking specific facial landmarks, 
particularly those associated with the eyes, which are crucial for detecting signs of 
drowsiness.
 The system will focus on measuring the eye-aspect ratio, a fundamental metric 
for assessing drowsiness. This ratio is calculated by determining the Euclidean 
distance between specific facial landmarks corresponding to the upper and lower 
eyelids.
An alert mechanism will be integrated into the system to promptly warn the driver 
upon detecting signs of drowsiness. This alert mechanism may include auditory 
alerts, visual warnings displayed on the dashboard, or haptic feedback through the 
steering wheel or seat, depending on user preferences and vehicle specifications.
